============

network hyper-parameters to run NIN on benchmark datasets.

The following 4 datasets are run in the paper.

#### CIFAR-10

#### CIFAR-100

#### SVHN

#### MNIST

The preprocessing of the datasets follows maxout.
The data are extracted from the pkl files generated by pylearn2 scripts, 
reshaped and dumped into pickle files with the format specified in alex krizhevsky's cuda-convnet.
The processed data can be found here.
